# PixelFest2016

Over a [weekend in April](http://www.pixelfest.org), four people gathered around a table on the sixth floor of [Slover Library](http://www.sloverlibrary.com/) and created their first real computer game, called _Chomp Chomp Treasure Mullusk_.  The theme of the game jam was simply "water".

## Chomp Chomp Treasure Mollusk

The game is simple:  you play a treasure-diving mollusk.  Your objective is to dive from your boat to the bottom of the sea and collect treasure.  But be careful on the way back to your boat!  You must dodge mines, submersibles, sharks, and more!  Not only that, but you can have up to three additional (networked) mollusks competing against you!  Who can gather the most treasure before time runs out?!?

### Credits

First, we'd like to thank the PixelFest and its organizers!  If they had not put this together and made it as successful as it was, CCTM would have never existed!  The event was a fun experience that we'd all readily do again.  And we ended up with a decent game, in the process!  Further, by keeping us off the streets for two solid days, it reduced the likelihood that any of us would have eaten any calamari.  In the end, that's two wins for mollusk-kind!

Second, we'd like to acknowledge two websites for the music and sound in the game.  Our group did not have a readily available audio designer, so we scrounged online for some free material.
